# Sistem Coffie Toffie
## Project Description
Sistem Coffie Toffie is a project that aims to provide a comprehensive guide to testing Python code using Pytest. Pytest is a popular testing framework for Python that provides a lot of features to make testing easier and more efficient.

## Getting Started
### Installing Pytest
To get started with Pytest, you need to install it first. You can install Pytest using pip:
```bash```
```pip install pytest```
### Writing Tests
Once you have Pytest installed, you can start writing tests. Pytest tests are written in Python and are typically placed in a separate file from the code being tested.
### Running Tests
To run your tests, you can use the pytest command:
```bash```
```pytest```

This will run all the tests in the current directory and its subdirectories.
### Test Discovery
Pytest has a feature called test discovery, which means it can automatically find and run tests without you having to specify them explicitly. This makes it easy to write and run tests for your code.
### Fixtures
Fixtures are a way to set up and tear down resources that are needed for your tests. They can be used to create test data, set up databases, or perform other tasks that are needed for your tests.
### Markers
Markers are a way to mark tests as needing to be run with certain conditions. For example, you can mark a test as needing to be run with a specific database connection.
### Plugins
Pytest has a lot of plugins available that can extend its functionality. Some plugins can help with things like code coverage, debugging, and more.
### Configuration
Pytest can be configured to change the way it runs tests. You can specify which tests to run, which directories to look in for tests, and more.
### Conclusion
Pytest is a powerful tool for testing Python code. With its features like test discovery, fixtures, markers, and plugins, it makes testing easier and more efficient.
